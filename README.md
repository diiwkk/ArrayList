# ArrayList

Assignment 3 defines 4 classes: ArrayListStack, LinkedListStack, ArrayListQueue, and LinkedListQueue. Each of these classes uses a different underlying data structure to implement the data structure, namely a stack or a queue.

ArrayListStack and LinkedListStack use ArrayList and LinkedList respectively to implement the stack data structure. The push method adds an element to the top of the stack, the pop method removes the top element from the stack and returns it, the peek method returns the top element without removing it, the isEmpty method checks if the stack is empty, and the size method returns the number of elements in the stack.

ArrayListQueueue and LinkedListQueueue implement the queue data structure with an array list and a linked list, respectively. The enqueue method adds an element to the end of the queue, the dequeue method removes the initial element from the queue and returns it, the peek method returns the initial element without removing it, the isEmpty method checks if the queue is empty, and the size method returns the number of elements in the queue.
